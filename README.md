# fittish-the-ultimate-fitness-app
A Graphical User Interface(GUI) which smartly calculates the BMI of a person and which statically suggests healthy range of curated diets to lose/gain weight, to ultimately stay fit. It is built using tkinter, a python package.

AIM:
To create an app that lets a person calculate their BMI along with an option to choose their diet accordingly.


PROBLEM STATEMENT:
1. A super-app in the health, fitness and well-being domain which calculates the Body Mass Index(BMI) of a person, which tracks the activity, which smartly suggests diets for the people of the present, which practically does every work one human needs to do to keep their health in check.


1.0 INTRODUCTION

The development and the incorporation of wireless technologies to promote healthy lifestyle behavior, specifically healthy eating and weight control, has the potential to address our ultimate goal of enabling healthy lifestyle to prevent obesity and obesity related diseases. A diet is all that we consume in a day. And a balanced diet is a diet that contains an adequate quantity of the nutrients that we require in a day. A balanced diet includes six main nutrients, i.e. Fats, Protein, Carbohydrates, Fibre, Vitamins, and Minerals. All these nutrients are present in the foods that we eat. Different food items have different proportions of nutrients present in them. The requirements of the nutrients depend on the age, gender, and health of a person.

“Your diet is a bank account. Good food choices are good investments.”

As mentioned above, a diet is an important part of our lives and our app allows a user to meet their goal easily. The diet plan recommended by our app consists of a wide variety of food including vegetables, whole grains, fruits, non-fat, low-fat, dairy products, beans, lean meat, poultry, and fish. However, each person has a unique dietary pattern and different health issues so the system lets a user create a meal plan depending on each case. This project aims to eliminate the need to
approach a dietician to get their diet plan, and to give a much easier and a simpler way where the user can easily access the diet plan.

1.1 PURPOSE

Our purpose is to develop a super app which suggests a customized diet according to the users needs based on users’ BMI and which gives them curated health tips for their wellness.

1.2 SCOPE

1. A user-friendly app.
2. To provide information about a balanced way of living which keeps their weight in check.
3. To provide a diet plan according to the users’ needs.
4. To calculate the Body Mass Index(BMI) of a user and redirect their interest to our diets’
section.

1.3 TECHNOLOGIES TO BE USED
1.3.1 Python

1.4 TOOLS TO BE USED
1.4.1 Tkinter package : The tkinter package (“Tk interface”) is the standard Python interface to the Tcl/Tk GUI toolkit.

1.5 OVERVIEW
1.5.1 OVERALL DESCRIPTION AND SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

Our app consists of a Register page and a Home page. When a user first opens our app, he is led straight to the Register page where they have a choice to click on two buttons: Health tip of the day and the Register button. If the user decides to click on the Health tip of the day button, our app displays a randomly generated health tip and is disabled from second click onwards to maintain the “one click per day” rule. This random health tip is generated by a python code which uses the random module and a tuple of curated health tips. If the user clicks on the Register button, he is redirected to a registration form which contains fields: full name, email, gender and age. After filling this form, there is a Submit button, which when clicked redirects the user to our app’s Home page. On the Home page, there are three buttons available: Know your diet, Calculate your BMI, and Logout. If the user clicks on the Know your diet button, he is redirected to a page which further lets him choose one of the diets suggested by our app and which also gives the user an option to go back to the Home page. Whichever diet he chooses to go with, he can always come back to the previous page. If the user chooses the Calculate your BMI button, he is redirected to a page where he needs to give his gender, height in centimeters and weight in kilograms as an input to our app. This form is created using a frame widget in tkinter and this form contains two buttons: Calculate and Go to home. The code that is running behind is of a python if-elif logic which outputs the status of the user's health based on his BMI. If he clicks on the Go to home button, he is redirected to the Home page again. If he clicks on the Logout button he is redirected back to the Register page. Buttons are widgets in tkinter.


2.0 PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE

Our app, Fittish, acts as a user-friendly interface for the people to track their health and delivers a perfect way to maintain it.

2.1 INTERFACE

A graphical user interface (GUI) is an interface through which a user interacts with electronic devices such as computers and smartphones through the use of icons, menus and other visual indicators or representations (graphics). GUIs graphically display information and related user controls, unlike text-based interfaces, where data and commands are strictly in text. GUI representations are manipulated by a pointing device such as a mouse, trackball, stylus, or by a finger on a touch screen.

2.2 SYSTEM FUNCTIONS

1. Displays status of their health based on the Body Mass Index(BMI) of a person.
2. Displays a variety of scientifically proven healthy diets for the users to choose.
3. Displays a randomly generated health tip everyday.

2.3 USER CHARACTERISTICS

1.User: The person whose data has been fetched and used to display the status of their health. Allowed to choose different diets based on their liking.

2.4 FUTURE SCOPE

In the future, we would also like to provide multiple features like:
-Activity tracker
-Period tracker(for women)
-Online consultations with experts
-Steps and calories burnt count
-Mental health AI assistant
-Platform to order customised food bowls
We want to make this a super-app, which is a one stop solution for a person’s health and
well-being.

2.5 ASSUMPTIONS AND DEPENDENCIES
A Database to store all the user’s information which is being used by our app.
